The beta version is running at [guide.aelve.com](https://guide.aelve.com). The most complete section yet is [the one about lenses](https://guide.aelve.com/haskell/lenses-sth6l9jl).

Installation instructions and the explanation of config variables (in `config.json`) are here: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Don't be afraid to install it locally – it's very easy! You don't need to set up any databases or anything like that, and you can get a full copy of the data from the site by simply cloning it from Github.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, grep the source for
`[very-easy]` and `[easy]`, or look at the [“your first pull request”](https://github.com/aelve/guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22your+first+pull+request%22) and [“your second pull request”](https://github.com/aelve/guide/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22your+second+pull+request%22) labels (the TODOs scattered around the code are more about small local tasks, while issues on the issue tracker are more broad). I'm very interested in having more people contribute to this project, so I'm willing to spend a couple of days explaining to you how to fix something, even if I could fix the issue by myself in an hour. So, if you want to experience the thrill of Fixing An Issue in an Open Source Project, write me!
