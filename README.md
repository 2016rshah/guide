Installation instructions and the explanation of config variables (in `config.json`) are here: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Don't be afraid to install it locally â€“ it's very easy! You don't need to set up any databases or anything like that, and you can get a full copy of the data from the site by simply cloning it from Github.

The beta version is running at [guide.aelve.com](http://guide.aelve.com).
