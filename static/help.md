You can edit everything, without registration. (But if you delete everything, I'll roll it back and then make a voodoo doll of you and stick some needles into it).

The most important rule is: **it's collaborative notes, not Wikipedia**. This implies two things. First, incomplete entries like this are welcome here:

> **pros:** pretty nice API\
> **cons:** buggy (see an example on my Github, here's the link)

Second, you should write as if you were writing for a friend. If a friend asks you about X, you don't go on X's site and copy the standard “X is a powerful modern framework blah blah blah” blurb – well, don't do it here either. Here is the whole version of the [unwritten rules](/unwritten-rules), except that they are written and aren't rules.

Markdown is supported in most places. 2 noteworthy features: you can write `[pkg](@hk)` to get a link to package `pkg` on Hackage (the full list of shortcuts is [here](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shortcut-links/docs/ShortcutLinks-All.html), and you can mark snippets of code with `repl` to show that they come from GHCi:
